# Blogless
The [Blogless publishing system](http://blogless.datenbrei.de/) is for web writers. Just publish, share your texts with friends and don't think about the rest.

>A website with the main purpose of having people read content would best serve its readers with almost nothing else but what’s needed for the reading experience  — Leo Babauta

Blogless is some kind of anti-blog. No subscribers, no community stress, no excuses for not having written the follow-up article in your vacation time, just articles. You even can switch off the RSS feed, the sitemap or the pingback functionality, if you like. Blogless sets the focus back from the needs and mechanisms of a blog to the pure content of your articles.

Blogless generates static HTML pages and lets you manage them from a simple to handle online interface. New articles can be written and later changed again. All the pretty SEO stuff, like descriptions, the now useless keywords, author name and profile, open graph meta infos and all that is included without beeing in the way — automagically.

## Installation
Just put it in the root of you webserver and call it - manual included as index.html.

## Status
Actually Blogless is in beta stage. It runs pretty well, but a bit of functionality is still missing. 

## Prerequisites
Blogless needs at least PHP version 5.5, released at 20th of June 2013. Also session handling needs to be set up in php.ini. When starting, Blogless will do the needed checks automatically and tell you, if your setup is sufficient.
